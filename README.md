# Focus Timer

The Focus Timer project is a joint work of Nic Bohm and Erik KÃ¼chler, created as part of our studies at HTW Berlin. Our goal is to develop an application that helps users manage their time and concentration.

## Description

The Focus Timer is a feature-rich time management application designed to help users optimize their productivity and maintain their focus. Here's a more detailed breakdown of its key functionalities:

- **Customizable Timer**: Users can set a time interval to structure their working or learning session.

- **Focus Maintenance**: While the timer is running, users are encouraged to remain concentrated on their tasks. The timer employs techniques like gamification or periodic prompts to discourage distractions and promote sustained attention.

- **Reward System**: As a motivational element, users earn virtual coins by successfully completing work intervals. These coins serve as a persistent incentive and can be redeemed for various rewards.

- **In-App Rewards**: Users have the option to use their hard-earned coins to purchase new backgrounds, themes, and design elements for the application. These elements can include aesthetically pleasing images such as trees, plants, or other decorations that users can use to make the application visually appealing and motivating.

- **Personalization**: The application allows users to customize the timer by choosing from a set of purchased design elements. This allows users to personalize the application according to their style and preferences.

- **Persistence and User Accounts**: All user preferences, customization choices, and coin balances are saved persistently within the user's account. This means that users can return to their personalized workspace and continue where they left off across devices.
